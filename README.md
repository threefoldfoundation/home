# Welcome to Github for the ThreeFold Foundation

We believe that content is like a product and as such we have chosen to use Github to work on all our content.
All our repos are open and opensource and you can contribute and leave issues so everyone can constantly improve.

## Releases

- [2.5.2](): deadline 27 Feb
- [2.5.3](): deadline 6 March
- [2.9](): deadline end of March (everything in here needs to be done before the launch of TF3.0), many items will be moved back to previous deadlines

Our projects can be found here: https://github.com/orgs/threefoldfoundation/projects
